# SB-Water-Quality
Using Santa Barbara water quality data and preciitation data to visualize trends in various water qualiy parameters.
Water Quality Parameters include: E. Coli, Entroccocus, Turbidity, D.O., pH, Temperature, Nitrate, and Phosphate.


#####Ideas (3/1/2018): #######

Swap out the channelkeeper data with the county data, at least for bacteria.

Station ID widget is not working. Make station ID actual site names or use a interactive map.

Date: Perhaps a two-point slider

Responsive graph axes threshhold lines. The current problem is that when you change the parameter, the axes do not adjust.

Parameters to keep? Total Bacteria, pH, Temp, DO, turbidity


The Plan:
Use just the county bacteria data for the four beaches.
Overlay rain data with bacteria data? Use a double y-axis ggplot.
Put in a map to select beach/station.
Date selection double-slider
